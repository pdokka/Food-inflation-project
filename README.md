This project explains the factors that influence Food Inflation. The datasets are collected from various sources and this was a collaborative project between me and my teammate Hritvik.

Starting with the jist of the story, Johnny who enjoys eating goes to the supermarket to buy his favorite food items from his saved pocket money and finds that the food prices have gone so up when compared to the previous years. To understand why this happens, he goes to his friend Robert who explains all the factors that decide the food prices.
Robert explains this by showing different visualizations which include various graphs created in Tableau to help Johnny understand better.

Hope you enjoy going through this project!
